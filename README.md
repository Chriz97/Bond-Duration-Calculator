# Bond Duration Calculator

This repository contains a Python function for calculating bond duration and modified duration, which are measures of a bond's sensitivity to changes in interest rates. 

The user can input various parameters of the bond, such as its face value, coupon rate, time to maturity, and yield-to-maturity, and the function will calculate the bond's duration and modified duration.

### Features
